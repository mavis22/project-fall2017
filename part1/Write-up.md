## The reason we took the approach
We used dot visualization on the map to represent the location of the earthquake detectors which distribute in the USA. The whole visualization will show use the infomation we got from the detectors 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan on March 11, 2011. As we mentionded before each dot on the map means a detetor location. For each point, it will change the color based on the earthquake strength which got by the detectors when we change the time slider. On the bottom right side of the visualization, it will show a line plot to represent the earthquake strength for the period by the selected detector on the left side map. While on the top right, the soectrogram willl represent the strength records by all the detectors and whole time period with the cross line to represent current detector and time.
## Strengths of our approach
This will give us a clear view of Tohoku earthquake, include of how long it last, when the highest strength is, how long the interval is between the earthquake and how the earthquake wave transmit. Since we made the visualization as the interactive. It will give the users better experience and chance to review the time or detector they are interested. 
## Weaknesses of our approach
  * We missed the map background. With a map background, it will be more clear to see where the stations are if we come with a backgroud.
  * It will be very good for us to add a play button, which can change the time slider automatically with variable steps. It will give better user experience.
  * A sound generater may help people to get better understand about how the strength was in the earthquake period.
## Things we wished we had been able to do
  * Data processing: Reorder the data by distance.
  * Data visualization: Map, spectrogram and line plot.
  * Intractive: Time slider and click event.
