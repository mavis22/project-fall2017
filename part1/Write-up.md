## The reason we took the approach

## Strengths of our approach

## Weaknesses of our approach
  * We missed the map background. With a map background, it will be more clear to see where the stations are.
  * It will be very good for us to add a play button, which can change the time slider automatically with variable steps. It will give better user experience.
## Things we wished we had been able to do
  * Data processing: Reorder the data by distance.
  * Data visualization: Map, spectrogram and line plot.
  * Intractive: Time slider and click event.
